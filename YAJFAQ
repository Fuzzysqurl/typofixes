Important Facts
  Real-time bidding
    Purchasing through Neokyo usually means that an operator is first going to review and validate the order before any payment is proceeded. However, Yahoo Auctions listings are handled in real-time. When you place a bid on Neokyo, it is immediately reflected on Yahoo Auctions. This induces potential pitfalls which we explain further on this page.
  
  Auction Deposit
    Before starting to bid, you will need to fund your auction deposit. This amount defines the total amount you may place on one or more bids at a time.
  
  Set your bid limit
    On Neokyo, you define the maximum amount of your bid. We will automatically bid on your behalf in the case someone starts outbidding you, up to the amount you originally set.
    If your maximum bid is beaten, we will notify you by email.
  
  Direct purchase
    Some sellers set a direct purchase price option in addition to the starting auction price. By paying this amount, you immediately secure the purchase. This price is usually displayed in green. Please note that your auction deposit still needs to match this amount.

Common pitfalls
  Usual precautions
    If you have not done so already, we would highly recommend a read-through of our good practice guidelines. This page sums up the risks inherent to proxying in general and how to avoid the common pitfalls on all shops.
  
  Ridiculously low-priced auction
    Some sellers launch auctions with very low starting price to attract potential bidders. These prices usually range from 1 to 99 yen. However, those offers are often risky as the seller might have set an unreasonably high domestic shipping price where they are making their profits.
    Use our button "Estimate domestic shipping cost" to have a look at the offered domestic rates. 
  
  Bidding on several low-priced auctions
    At first, you might think that placing bids on a lot of cheap auctions is interesting.
    Keep in mind you will incur the 250 yen service fee, the domestic shipping cost, and potential wire fee for each auction you win.
    Therefore, we would always advise to look for sets of items rather than individual items as it will generally be a better deal. This advice is especially true if you are a trading card, video game or figure collector. 
  
  Real-time bidding means no screening by the team
    Bidding through Neokyo means bidding directly through Yahoo. It is your responsibility to make sure that we can ship your item.
      Have a serious read-through of the forbidden item list
      Do not forget about the "contained or having contained" rule. An item having been in contact with a substance part of the forbidden list in the past will be forbidden as well, even if it is cleaned or emptied.
      Keep in mind we cannot refund you if a mistake was made.
      If you are planning on bidding on a high-valued item, use common sense to avoid bad surprises. If you think that there is even a rather small risk bidding on a given pricy auction, do not take it.

  Some auctions are pick-up only
    Some shops (especially the ones dealing with heavy or oversized items) do not ship to the auction winners and expect them to pick up the item from a physical location, such as a retail store.
    We unfortunately cannot deal with this kind of listing and no refund will be issued in the event you won the auction. This is another good reason to thoroughly read the listing using DeepL, or reach out to us if you have any doubt. 

  We do not modify your items
    This rule is actually tied to the forbidden item list. For example, we will not empty a fragrance bottle, unmount a tire from its rim, or unscrew an airbag out of a car wheel. 

  There is no dispute or claim system
    Yahoo is NOT a customer-friendly marketplace. We block seller profiles with too few or bad ratings by default, but nevertheless, you should still aim at very highly-rated seller profiles to avoid any problems.
    As an important reminder: paying through Paypal does not means having a risk-free transaction! It is your responsibility to do your due diligence before bidding. Disputing an amount due to an auction going badly is not our fault as we only provide the ability to bid on the site and have no other involvement in the listing itself. 

  Text in the auction pics  
    While it is easy to use the translation tools to get a grasp of the auction terms, some seller place highly-important information in the item pictures, which cannot be easily translated. You can use a smartphone application, such as Google Translate, to scan the image and attempt to translate it. Please contact us if you need help translating or understanding what the text implies.

  Purchasing from the same seller 
    We cannot message a seller to ask for several won auctions to be combined into one shipment.
    Yahoo Auctions automatically let the seller know when you have other ongoing offers and will usually suggest to offer a combined shipment for auctions won within 72 hours.
    However, the final decision is entirely up to the seller.

Once an auction is won
  Here what happens once you win an auction or place a successful instant purchase:
      The auction is now considered as an "Order" and can be found under this subsection on your user dashboard.
      We temporarily place the auction amount on hold on your auction deposit until the auction is paid to the seller by our team (usually within 48 hours).
      Once the auction payment is settled with the seller, we issue the final invoice for this auction (the domestic shipping cost might be deferred to a future invoice if the seller opted for a Cash on Delivery shipment).
      We automatically transfer the final auction invoice amount from your auction deposit to your wallet to ease its payment. You are notified that this auction can be paid through an email notification.
      Payment is open for 7 days on your user interface. Please be aware that a delayed payment might induce a 200 yen weekly late penalty fee so we suggest clearing your invoices on a regular basis.
      Once your won auction arrives at the warehouse, you are notified as well. You can then store it up to 45 days and ship it anytime with other orders as per our usual service features
